935,2910,These are called tau tau.,False,409898,1832

946,3134,"that all people will become grandparents,",False,443782,1832
947,2381,"and what this means is that after death,",False,446916,1832
948,2849,we all become part of the ancestral line,False,449297,1832

962,2579,that they will invest the money in this,False,484711,1832
963,2427,because they want to repay their parents,False,487290,1832

965,2514,investing and caring for them.,False,492962,1832
966,2710,But the sacrifice of buffalo,True,495476,1832
967,2687,and the ritual display of wealth,False,498186,1832
968,3055,"also exhibits the status of the deceased,",False,500873,1832

970,4128,"So at funerals, relationships are reconfirmed",False,507220,1832

974,5266,its impact on life and the relationships of the living.,False,520079,1832
975,2815,So all of this focus on death,True,525345,1832
976,2636,doesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire,False,528160,1832
977,2676,to the ideal of a long life.,False,530796,1832
978,2069,They engage in many practices,False,533472,1832

1201,3000,"More boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping.",False,205000,131

2125,2000,"It's the teaching hospital for Harvard ,",False,488000,1126
2126,2000,one of the best hospitals in the country.,False,490000,1126

2130,3000,Everything seems to have gone fine.,False,500000,1126

2133,3000,Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages,False,510000,1126

2135,3000,on her left leg instead of her right one.,False,515000,1126
2136,3000,When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel,False,519000,1126

2141,2000,that he was on the correct side of the patient.,False,533000,1126
2143,2000,The point of this story,False,540000,1126

2145,3000,of being on the correct side of anything,False,545000,1126
2146,3000,can be very dangerous.,False,548000,1126

2171,3000,they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.,False,619000,1126
2172,3000,"When that doesn't work,",False,622000,1126

2174,2000,"and they still disagree with us,",False,627000,1126
2175,2000,"then we move on to a second assumption,",False,629000,1126

3744,2769,what today we would call hallucinations.,False,100063,2510
3745,2626,"And only then, as time went on,",False,103888,2510
3746,3651,"they began to recognize that they were the creators,",False,106538,2510
3747,2515,the owners of these inner voices.,False,110213,2510

3749,2483,the ability to think about their own thoughts.,False,116055,2510
3750,3397,"So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness,",True,119785,2510

3752,3540,"where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence ,",False,126396,2510
3753,2737,is a quite recent cultural development.,False,129960,2510
3754,1786,"And this theory is quite spectacular,",False,133456,2510
3755,1433,but it has an obvious problem,False,135266,2510
3756,3992,which is that it's built on just a few and very specific examples.,False,136723,2510
3757,1763,So the question is whether the theory,False,141085,2510
3758,4751,"that introspection built up in human history only about 3,000 years ago",False,142872,2510
3759,2984,can be examined in a quantitative and objective manner.,False,147647,2510
3760,3563,And the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious.,True,151543,2510
3761,3460,"It's not like Plato woke up one day and then he wrote,",False,155130,2510
3762,1659,"Hello, I'm Plato,",False,158614,2510
3763,2889,"and as of today, I have a fully introspective consciousness.",False,160297,2510
3765,3333,And this tells us actually what is the essence of the problem.,True,165527,2510
3766,4055,We need to find the emergence of a concept that's never said.,False,169467,2510
3767,4310,The word introspection does not appear a single time,False,174434,2510
3768,1919,in the books we want to analyze.,False,178768,2510
3769,4087,So our way to solve this is to build the space of words.,True,181728,2510
3770,3287,This is a huge space that contains all words,False,186571,2510
3771,2802,in such a way that the distance between any two of them,False,189882,2510
3772,2883,is indicative of how closely related they are.,False,192708,2510
3773,1151,"So for instance,",False,196460,2510
3774,2897,"you want the words dog and cat to be very close together,",False,197635,2510
3775,3831,but the words grapefruit and logarithm to be very far away.,False,200556,2510
3776,3896,And this has to be true for any two words within the space.,False,204809,2510
3777,3341,And there are different ways that we can construct the space of words.,True,209626,2510
3778,1643,"One is just asking the experts,",False,212991,2510
3779,1896,a bit like we do with dictionaries.,False,214658,2510
3780,1428,Another possibility,False,216896,2510
3781,3715,"is following the simple assumption that when two words are related,",False,218348,2510
3782,2349,"they tend to appear in the same sentences,",False,222087,2510
3783,1453,"in the same paragraphs,",False,224460,2510
3784,1770,"in the same documents,",False,225937,2510
3785,3182,more often than would be expected just by pure chance.,False,227731,2510
3786,2050,"And this simple hypothesis,",False,232231,2510
3787,1306,"this simple method,",False,234305,2510
3788,1607,with some computational tricks,False,235635,2510
3789,1389,that have to do with the fact,False,237266,2510
3790,3064,"that this is a very complex and high-dimensional space,",False,238679,2510
3791,1665,turns out to be quite effective.,False,241767,2510
3792,2802,"And just to give you a flavor of how well this works,",True,244155,2510
3793,3912,this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words.,False,246981,2510
3794,1185,And you can see first,False,251607,2510
3795,3278,that words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods.,False,252816,2510
3796,2217,"So you get the fruits, the body parts,",False,256118,2510
3797,2425,"the computer parts, the scientific terms and so on.",False,258359,2510
3798,4222,The algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy.,True,261119,2510
3799,1151,"So for instance,",False,265852,2510
3800,3597,you can see that the scientific terms break down into two subcategories,False,267027,2510
3801,2100,of the astronomic and the physics terms.,False,270648,2510
3802,2246,And then there are very fine things.,False,273338,2510
3803,1905,"For instance, the word astronomy,",False,275608,2510
3804,1815,"which seems a bit bizarre where it is,",False,277537,2510
3805,2048,"is actually exactly where it should be,",False,279376,2510
3806,1595,"between what it is,",False,281448,2510
3807,1270,"an actual science,",False,283067,2510
3808,1536,"and between what it describes,",False,284361,2510
3809,1492,the astronomical terms.,False,285921,2510
3810,1891,And we could go on and on with this.,True,288182,2510
3811,2060,"Actually, if you stare at this for a while,",False,290097,2510
3812,1858,"and you just build random trajectories,",False,292181,2510
3813,3166,you will see that it actually feels a bit like doing poetry.,False,294063,2510
3814,1882,"And this is because, in a way,",False,298018,2510
3815,2940,walking in this space is like walking in the mind.,False,299924,2510
3816,1617,And the last thing,True,304027,2510
3817,4040,"is that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions,",False,305668,2510
3818,3896,of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection.,False,309732,2510
3819,1223,"So for instance,",False,313652,2510
3820,3979,"words such as self, guilt, reason, emotion,",False,314899,2510
3821,1889,"are very close to introspection,",False,318902,2510
3822,1151,"but other words,",False,320815,2510
3823,2167,"such as red, football, candle, banana,",False,321990,2510
3824,1452,are just very far away.,False,324181,2510
3825,2762,"And so once we've built the space,",True,326054,2510
3826,2826,"the question of the history of introspection,",False,328840,2510
3827,2333,or of the history of any concept,False,331690,2510
3828,4779,"which before could seem abstract and somehow vague,",False,334047,2510
3829,1604,"becomes concrete ,",False,338850,2510
3830,2738,becomes amenable to quantitative science.,False,340478,2510
3831,2762,"All that we have to do is take the books,",True,344216,2510
3832,1381,"we digitize them,",False,347002,2510
3833,2809,and we take this stream of words as a trajectory,False,348407,2510
3834,1969,"and project them into the space,",False,351240,2510
3835,3754,and then we ask whether this trajectory spends significant time,False,353233,2510
3836,2992,circling closely to the concept of introspection.,False,357011,2510
3837,1196,"And with this,",True,360760,2510
3838,2112,we could analyze the history of introspection,False,361980,2510
3839,1921,"in the ancient Greek tradition,",False,364116,2510
3840,2602,for which we have the best available written record.,False,366061,2510
3841,2255,"So what we did is we took all the books ,",False,369631,2510
3842,2284,"we just ordered them by time ,",False,371910,2510
3843,1752,for each book we take the words,False,374218,2510
3844,1961,"and we project them to the space,",False,375994,2510
3845,3032,"and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection,",False,377979,2510
3846,1230,and we just average that.,False,381035,2510
3847,3198,"And then we ask whether, as time goes on and on,",False,382590,2510
3848,3252,"these books get closer, and closer and closer",False,385812,2510
3849,1754,to the concept of introspection.,False,389088,2510
3850,3801,And this is exactly what happens in the ancient Greek tradition.,True,390866,2510
3851,3127,"So you can see that for the oldest books in the Homeric tradition,",False,395698,2510
3852,3412,there is a small increase with books getting closer to introspection.,False,398849,2510
3853,2206,"But about four centuries before Christ,",False,402285,2510
3854,4708,this starts ramping up very rapidly to an almost five-fold increase,False,404515,2510
3855,2500,"of books getting closer, and closer and closer",False,409247,2510
3856,1682,to the concept of introspection.,False,411771,2510
3857,2424,And one of the nice things about this,False,414159,2510
3858,1198,is that now we can ask,False,416607,2510
3859,4147,"whether this is also true in a different, independent tradition.",False,417829,2510
3860,3176,"So we just ran this same analysis on the Judeo-Christian tradition,",True,422962,2510
3861,2721,and we got virtually the same pattern.,False,426162,2510
3862,4635,"Again, you see a small increase for the oldest books in the Old Testament,",False,429548,2510
3863,1914,and then it increases much more rapidly,False,434207,2510
3864,1839,in the new books of the New Testament.,False,436145,2510
3865,2032,And then we get the peak of introspection,False,438008,2510
3866,2127,"in The Confessions of Saint Augustine,",False,440064,2510
3867,1857,about four centuries after Christ.,False,442215,2510
3868,1944,"And this was very important,",False,444897,2510
3869,3373,"because Saint Augustine had been recognized by scholars,",False,446865,2510
3870,2172,"philologists, historians,",False,450262,2510
3871,2078,as one of the founders of introspection.,False,452458,2510
3872,3297,"Actually, some believe him to be the father of modern psychology.",False,455060,2510
3873,1839,"So our algorithm,",True,459012,2510
3874,2842,"which has the virtue of being quantitative,",False,460875,2510
3875,1263,"of being objective,",False,463741,2510
3876,2016,"and of course of being extremely fast ,",False,465028,2510
3877,2397,"it just runs in a fraction of a second ,",False,467068,2510
3878,3503,can capture some of the most important conclusions,False,469489,2510
3879,2222,of this long tradition of investigation.,False,473016,2510
3880,3651,"And this is in a way one of the beauties of science,",False,476317,2510
3881,3476,which is that now this idea can be translated,False,479992,2510
3882,2571,and generalized to a whole lot of different domains.,False,483492,2510
3883,4767,"So in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness,",True,486769,2510
3884,3406,maybe the most challenging question we can pose to ourselves,False,491560,2510
3885,4137,is whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness.,False,494990,2510
3886,1470,"To put it more precisely,",False,499550,2510
3887,2416,whether the words we say today,False,501044,2510
3888,5197,"can tell us something of where our minds will be in a few days,",False,503484,2510
3889,1151,in a few months,False,508705,2510
3890,1182,or a few years from now.,False,509880,2510

3900,3001,"who has been my brother in this adventure,",False,536645,2510
3901,1555,we took on this task.,False,539670,2510
3902,5532,And we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people,False,542228,2510
3903,2801,who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia.,False,547784,2510
3904,2881,"And so what we did is, we measured speech at day one,",True,551434,2510

3911,2793,to predict the future organization of the mind.,False,573699,2510
3912,1809,It was good enough,False,576516,2510

3916,1706,But then we realized,True,589164,2510
3917,4088,"that maybe the most important thing was not so much what they were saying,",False,590894,2510

3922,2301,from one semantic neighborhood to the other one.,False,604398,2510
